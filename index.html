                <p>Hello! My name is Hnin Ei Shwe Yee. I'm a first-year student at Ritsumeikan University, studying information systems engineering. Before coming to Japan, I studied Architecture for two years in my home country. I realized that while architecture is fascinating, it wasn't quite the right fit for me, so I decided to switch to something I'm truly passionate about—technology and engineering.
<p>When I'm not buried in my studies, you'll probably find me in the kitchen experimenting with new recipes and whipping up delicious meals. Cooking is one of my favorite hobbies, and I love exploring different cuisines and flavors.</p>
                <p>I am a huge dog lover and have a husky who keeps me company. He is very playful, energetic and always puts a smile on my face. I’m also a huge fan of the beach. There's something about the sound of the waves and the feel of sand between my toes that I find incredibly calming.</p>
              <p>Anyways, that's a bit about me! Thank you and have fun exploring my webpage!</p>
